Our main topics involve 

- **Molecular effects of environmental exposures and their sex differences.** Environmental exposures are fundamental in contributing to health and disease. Understanding their molecular consequences can help generate mechanistic hypotheses on how exposures lead to specific diseases. We are working on two projects: sex differences in tobacco smoke exposure and molecular effects of pesticide and welding fume exposures.

- **Sex differences in neurodegenerative disorders.**
Even though several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, show clear patterns of sex differences, there is a lack of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying such differences. We are working on understanding the molecular differences between sexes in Alzheimer's disease.

- **Bioethical dimensions of climate change.**
Contributions to the bioethical dimensions of climate change have been welcoming but scarce. Bioethics scholarship is fundamental to understanding and bringing attention to the injustices brought about by preventable socio-ecological degradation. We are currently working on incorporating indigenous philosophical perspectives on environmental justice.
