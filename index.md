# Welcome to the SHAB Lab!

We are an interdisciplinary research group at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in Santiago, Chile. Our aim at the **S**ituated **H**ealth **A**nd **B**iology Lab is to understand the local environmental and sociocultural effects on human health and biology.

To that end, we develop novel statistical and analytical methodologies to use big data in biology and innovate in the ethical aspects involving environmental impacts on human health. See our [Research](_pages/research) for more information.

If you are interested in joining our lab, see more [information](_pages/positions).
