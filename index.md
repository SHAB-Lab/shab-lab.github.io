# Welcome to the SHAB Lab!

We are an interdisciplinary research group at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in Santiago, Chile.
At the **S**ituated **H**ealth **A**nd **B**iology Lab, we investigate how biological, environmental, and social factors interact to shape health and disease, with a particular focus on sex differences, neurodegenerative disorders, and the molecular consequences of environmental exposures.
Using multi-omic approaches and bioethical inquiry, we strive to generate knowledge that not only advances biomedical science but also informs policies for health equity and environmental justice.
By integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, we seek to understand disease within its broader ecological and societal context, fostering research that is both scientifically rigorous and socially responsible.
To that end, we develop novel statistical and analytical methodologies to use big data in biology and innovate in the ethical aspects involving environmental impacts on human health.
